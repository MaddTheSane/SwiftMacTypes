	/// This allows an installer for an input method bundle or a keyboard

	/// sources should be registered. The system can then locate the
	/// specified file or bundle and perform any necessary cache rebuilds

	/// `TISCreateInputSourceList` with appropriate properties (e.g.
	/// `BundleID` or `InputSourceID`) in order to get `TISInputSource`s for
	/// one or more of the newly registered input sources.
	///
	/// This can only be used to register the following:
	///
	/// - Keyboard layout files or bundles in "/Library/Keyboard
	/// Layouts/" or "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/" (available to all
	/// users or current user, respectively). Such keyboard layouts, once
	/// enabled, are selectable.
	///
	/// - Input method bundles in the new "/Library/Input Methods/" or
	/// "~/Library/Input Methods/" directories (available to all users or
	/// current user, respectively).
	///
	/// Note: Input method bundles can include private non-selectable
	/// keyboard layouts for use with
	/// `TISSetInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride`. These are registered
	/// automatically when the input method is registered, and do not
	/// need to be separately registered.
	///
	/// Security: Any code that calls `registerInputSource(at:)` is part of
	/// an application or service that has already been validated in some
	/// way (e.g. by the user).
	/// - parameter location: `URL` for the location of the input source(s), a
